Ideas for improvement


Euler Force:
Make Euler force svg rotate with an arrow showing which direction the Euler force is in as it accelerates/decceclerates
Change it so the arrows can be dragged and dropped into their correct position (adds interactivity and enforces teaching element of the page)
     -> Shouldn't be impossible since Cyd has already done dragging and moving objects in his electrostatics module

Derivation:
Add a little p5.grafica animation to each column with two arrows, one showing an example of the vector in the rotating frame and the other in the intertial frame
     -> Page is already crowded so would need a layout change (e.g. dedicating an entire page to each column and having a button switch between pages)


Centrifugal Force:
Add stars to the background of the p5 canvas (just to fill up blank space and also make it look nicer)
Add a page discussing another interesting feature of the Earth (changing direction of g so straight down isn't centre of Earth)
Design-wise it looks like its missing something but not quite sure, someone more talented creatively could probably figure it out
